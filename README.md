# PanesOS
Panes was originally written in Python, and the source code is available [here](https://github.com/kaubu/panesos).  
Currently, nothing *really* happens. That is because it hasn't reached v1.0 yet.

* Added more commands, and sorted them in a pseudo-modular fashion
* Commands added:
    - version - To check the current version
